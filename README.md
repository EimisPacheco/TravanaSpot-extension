  ## What it does

  TravanaSpot is a Chrome extension that enhances the Airbnb browsing experience by providing
  AI-powered review analysis through a friendly assistant called "Little Airby". When users visit an
   Airbnb listing page, the extension automatically extracts listing data and up to 100 guest
  reviews, then uses Google's Gemini AI to generate comprehensive insights, sentiment analysis, and
  answers to specific questions about the property.
